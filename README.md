# Image segmentation

An in-depth overview of the problem of image segmentation within the digital image processing chain. The paper describes various approaches to image segmentation, i.e., region-oriented, line-oriented and hybrid approaches, and later focuses on edge detection as an example of image segmentation by analyzing Canny's ideal formal edge detector, introduced in J. Canny, A Computational Approach to Edge Detection, 1986.

## Folder struccture

- `notebook` folder contains a Jupyter notebook with a Canny edge detector's implementation from scratch and related experiments against OpenCV's base implementation;

- `report` folder contains an overview of image segmentation with an edge detection perspective.
