# Image segmentation

An in-depth overview of the problem of image segmentation within the image processing chain. The paper describes various approaches to image segmentation, and later focuses on edge detection as an example of image segmentation by analyzing Canny's ideal formal edge detector, introduced in J. Canny, A Computational Approach to Edge Detection, 1986.

## Folder struccture

- `notebook` folder contains a Jupyter notebook with a Canny edge detector's implementation and related experiments against OpenCV's base implementation;

- `report` folder contains an overview of image segmentation analyzed through the edge detection example.
